Day 3 Review
Topics Learned:
Class Creation & Constructor Use – Understood how to define classes, initialize attributes using __init__, and create object instances.
Inheritance & Multiple Inheritance – Learned how a subclass inherits methods and attributes from a parent class, and how multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent.
Encapsulation – Explored the use of private (__var) and protected (_var) attributes to restrict direct access and enhance data security.
Polymorphism – Implemented method overriding in subclasses to allow different behaviors for the same method.
Difficulties Faced:
Understanding multiple inheritance and resolving conflicts when two parent classes have methods with the same name.
Using encapsulation correctly while still allowing necessary access to private and protected attributes.
Polymorphism implementation was slightly challenging in ensuring each subclass overrides the method correctly.
