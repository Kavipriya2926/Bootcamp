Day 2 Review  

Topics Learned:  
Feature Impact Analysis – Understood how feature importance affects model predictions.  
Polynomial Regression – Learned how to fit a polynomial model to capture non-linearity.  
Outlier Impact – Analyzed how outliers distort regression models.  
Regularization (Lasso & Ridge)** – Explored how L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization prevent overfitting by reducing or eliminating coefficients.  

Difficulties Faced:  
Understanding how to interpret feature importance values correctly.  
Finding the right polynomial degree for better model accuracy without overfitting.  
Handling outliers effectively without losing important data points.  
Adjusting the regularization strength (alpha) in Ridge and Lasso for optimal model performance.
