Day 4 Review

Topics Learned:

Basic & Multiple Linear Regression – Understood how to build regression models using one or multiple predictors and evaluate them using R-squared.
Data Visualization – Learned how to plot data points and regression lines to interpret model fit visually.
Model Assessment & Feature Impact – Explored how to evaluate models using R-squared and RMSE and analyze the significance of each feature in predictions.
Polynomial Regression & Outlier Impact – Learned how polynomial regression captures non-linearity and how outliers can distort model accuracy.
Regularization (Lasso & Ridge) – Understood how to use L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.

Difficulties Faced:

Interpreting regression metrics like RMSE and R-squared effectively.
Finding the right polynomial degree without overfitting the model.
Handling outliers correctly to maintain model accuracy without losing useful data.
Choosing the correct regularization strength (alpha) for Lasso and Ridge to balance model complexity and performance.
